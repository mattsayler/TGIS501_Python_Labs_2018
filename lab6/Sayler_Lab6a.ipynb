    "I know it seems like only yesterday we were first writing \"import arcpy,\" but here we are. You've learned a lot along the way and now, in this final lab, I'm going to ask you to put it all together, try some new things, and *have fun* with your new skills. The lab comes in two parts 6a and 6b, which you'll get next week, and is due **March 1st** (so two weeks *after* you get part b).\n",

    "In part a, we'll be playing with APIs - namely the ArcGIS API and Twitter's Streaming API. We use Esri's because it is the direction they are taking their product and Twitter's because it is well established and well-documented. *Their use here is not an endorsement or signal of the meaning to be found in tweets or the mapping thereof.*"

    "Ultimately, you are going to make some interactive web maps of tweets for me. However, the exact means by which you do it is left up to you (i.e. will you use Folium or the ArcGIS API, perhaps geopandas to handle the back end, etc.). As such, I'm going to recommend you create an environment with the following libraries, but you may not end up using them all:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda create -n lab6 python=3.6`\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've created and activated that environment, install the following:\n",

    "\n",
    "`conda install -c conda-forge geopandas jupyter folium fiona tweepy geopy`\n",
    "\n",
    "You should recognize most of those libraries, but the last two are new. I am using [tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) to access the Twitter API, there are lots of other libraries. A popular one you might use is [TwitterSearch](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/TwitterSearch/). Additionally, [geopy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/TwitterSearch/) is a geocoding library for python. Again, lots of these exist and you are free to find one that works best for you; however, your examples will be using these libraries."
