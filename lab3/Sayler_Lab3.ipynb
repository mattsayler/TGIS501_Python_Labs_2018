    "This lab continues our work on the syntax and functions of the python language. It also integrates this work with the means of automating ArcGIS desktop (and some server) through the ArcPy site package. Later on in the course we'll discuss ArcPro and the ArcGIS API for python, but - _in this lab_ - we focus on the more established means of automation.\n",
