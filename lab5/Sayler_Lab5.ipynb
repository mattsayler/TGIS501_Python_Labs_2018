    "### Question One - Drunken Walk\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Gosh, I just love those turtles. \n",
    "More seriously, I appreciate vector graphics on a (bounded) plane. So let's get underway, shall we?\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh noes. Our favorite turtle has drunk too much watching his favorite NFL team (the Patriots, obviously; alternatively, if you prefer, our poor turtle can be a time-displaced fan of the [Hartford Whalers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJtiepwpKFw)).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is now time for our turtle to (attempt to) stumble home. To do so, you're going to work your way through a version of a classic [random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk). **I will stress this several times throughout, but: there are many ways to approach this problem, you should focus on the one that *makes sense to you***.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are going to write a 'simulation' in which our 'turtle' takes up to 500 steps to try to reach home, but does so by following a 'random(ish)' pattern. This isn't a _true_ random walk due to the constraints I am placing, but it will still force you to think through the same ideas (and a few extras!). It's also worth noting it's very unlikely the poor turtle will find their way home within 1,000 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to write a script that:\n",
    "1. Your 'turtle' begins at (-122, 47)\n",
    "2. Your 'turtle's' home is (-71, 42)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Your 'turtle' moves randomly following these rules: The turtle moves **one** step in a **randomly** selected direction. In other words, the initial direction is selected randomly; subsequently, the turtle **randomly** selects to turn to the left 90 degrees, to the right 90 degrees, or continue in the direction last followed and takes another step.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The plane is bounded. The walls are at (-180, Y), (180, Y); (X, 90), (X, -90). You can probably guess why, huh?\n",
    "5. If your turtle walks into the 'wall,' they immediately 'bounce' five pixels backwards and turn around 180 degrees. It then begins walking again. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. After 500 steps **or** arriving at (-71, 42), the walk is over (morning has broken). \n",
    "\n",
    "8. After the walk, you'll want to know: where the turtle ended up (final location); how far that location is from where it began; how far the turtle is from 'home' (you can use straight line distance here). Print these out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you do not have to create your own functions and classes for this; however, I strongly recommend it (as things will get more complicated we we go on). "

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You've probably noticed two things: \n",
    "1. Gosh, that takes a long time.\n",
    "2. The turtle is very unlikely to end up 'home'.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's **ok**, in fact, it's expected. Let's help our turtle out a bit by making things a little *less* random. We're going to change how our turtle moves in a couple of ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The turtle now changes directions in 45 degree increments (so it turns left or right 45 instead of 90).\n",
    "2. The turtle now always moves in the 'right' direction, In other words, before taking each step, the turtle 'checks' to make sure they are not headed away from their home (the distance from 'home' is the same or less than their current location).\n",
    "\n",
    "How might you do this? There are a few approaches. I might create a function (or method) that compares proposed new location to previous location (checking distance and forcing a new step selection when needed). Remember, steps are *still chosen randomly*, the turtle just stumbles in the right direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There is an additional difficulty here where, by turning 45 degrees, the turtle is unable to ever *reach home exactly*. **For this problem, 'home' is considered anywhere within a distance of 1 from (-71, 42).** This should solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",

    "Ok, for the record, having a vector 'draw' each step of a random walk is highly inefficient. You could just as easily create a mathematical matrix and have your 'turtle' move across that. Doing so would be much, much faster and allow for you to run simulations of 1,000+ steps thousands of times. \n",
